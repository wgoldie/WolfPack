# WolfPack

A clone of the Wolf3D CPU renderer. Not performant on era hardware, but uses similar techniques.

Currently a raycaster with texture mapping (greyscale only), player movement, and free look (z rotation only).

Use WASD to move - it's tank controls like in original Wolfenstein.

# Building

Requires openframeworks, no plugins.
The project is set up for VS2013 but can probably be built just fine under Linux or OSX.
